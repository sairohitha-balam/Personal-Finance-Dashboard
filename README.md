## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```
### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

## 3. Run the Application

### ðŸ…° Option A: Simple (Open the File)

Simply open the `index.html` file in your default web browser.

---

### ðŸ…± Option B: Recommended (Run a Local Server)

Running a local server avoids potential browser security restrictions with `localStorage`.

#### If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
# 1. Install serve (if you don't have it)
npm install -g serve

# 2. Run the local server
serve
```
Then open the URL provided in your terminal (usually http://localhost:3000).

Or, if you have Python 3:
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Then, open http://localhost:8000 (for Python) in your browser.


## Future Enhancements

### Data Export
Add the ability to **export transaction and investment history** as a `.csv` file for backups or analysis.
